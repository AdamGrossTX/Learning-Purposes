Last I checked, this still worked. This is a SEMI-AUTOMATIC warranty checker (thanks to HP's recaptcha...)
The CSV format I used (which I pulled all of my computer information from ConfigMgr WQL) is:
  - Computer Name
  - Make of the computer (Manufacturer)
  - Model of the computer
  - Serial number
  - Product SKU
